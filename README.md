- Minimum Compatible FortiSOAR™ Version : 7.2.0
- Authored By: Fortinet
- Certified: No

## Overview
### Introduction
This article describes the Malware Response Using SIEM & EDR Solutions Pack. The solution pack demonstrates the scenarios and use cases around Malware reported by ElasticSearch or Splunk.

Configure ingestion using ElasticSearch or Splunk connector. Ingestion process creates an alert of type 'Malware', and then manually triggers the response workflow.

Refer to Simulation Scenarios - "Malware Response Using SIEM and EDR Solutions (ElasticSearch / Active Directory / VMware vSphere)" or "Malware Response Using SIEM and EDR Solutions (Splunk/QRadar/FortiEDR)" to experience the use case without ElasticSearch or Splunk connector configuration.

### Usage 
This Solution Pack ships with following simulation scenarios. [Refer](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/solution-pack-guide.md) to Simulate Scenario documentation to undersand how to Simulate and Reset Scenario. 

#### 1. Scenario - Malware Response Using SIEM and EDR Solutions (ElasticSearch / Active Directory / VMware vSphere)
The scenario generates a demo alert of Type 'Malware'.
Goto generated alert and observe the following:
- Asset details like Device UID, File Hash.
- Also, Process Name, Command Line, Source Process, Source IP and Destination IP

**Investigate Malware Response (ElasticSearch / Active Directory / VMware vSphere)** : Launch "Investigate Malware Response (ElasticSearch / Active Directory / VMware vSphere)" Playbook and observe various investigation activities such as
- List of affected Hosts using ElasticSearch
- Active affected Hosts using ElasticSearch
- Search active affected Hosts using the Active Directory 
- Find Malicious Indicator associated with the Malware Alert
- Take VM Snapshot using VMware vSphere

#### 2. Scenario - Malware Response Using SIEM and EDR Solutions (Splunk/QRadar/FortiEDR)
The scenario generates a demo alert of Type 'Malware'.
Goto generated alert and observe the following:
- Asset details like Computer Name, File Name, File Hash and Source IP

**Investigate Malware Response (Splunk/QRadar/FortiEDR)** : Launch "Investigate Malware Response (Splunk/QRadar/FortiEDR)" Playbook and observe various investigation activities such as
- Find Malicious Indicators of the Alert and Scan the Endpoint
- If no malicious indicators then investigate endpoint manually to detemine if this is malicious activity
- Hunt the Malicious Indicators using Splunk, QRadar and FortiEDR
- Block the Malicious Indicators
