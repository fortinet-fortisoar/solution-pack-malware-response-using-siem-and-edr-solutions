# Usage

Refer to [Simulate Scenario documentation](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/solution-pack-guide.md) to understand how to simulate and reset scenarios. 

To understand the process FortiSOAR follows to respond to malware using SIEM and EDR solutions, we have included two scenarios with this solution pack. Refer to the following sections to understand how this solution pack's automation addresses your needs. 
- Malware Response Using SIEM and EDR Solutions (ElasticSearch / Active Directory / VMware vSphere)
- Malware Response Using SIEM and EDR Solutions (Splunk/QRadar/FortiEDR)

## Malware Response Using SIEM and EDR Solutions (ElasticSearch / Active Directory / VMware vSphere)

This scenario generates an example alert of Type *Malware* in FortiSOAR's **Alerts** module.

Navigate to the created demo alert and note the following:

- Asset details like Device UID, File Hash.
- Details like Process Name, Command Line, Source Process, Source IP, and Destination IP

Select the alert and launch the playbook **Investigate Malware Response (ElasticSearch / Active Directory / VMware vSphere)** to perform following automated tasks:

- List affected Hosts using ElasticSearch
- View active affected Hosts using ElasticSearch
- Search active affected Hosts using the Active Directory
- Find malicious indicators associated with the Malware Alert
- Take a VM Snapshot using VMware vSphere

## Malware Response Using SIEM and EDR Solutions (Splunk/QRadar/FortiEDR)

This scenario generates an example alert of Type *Malware* in FortiSOAR's **Alerts** module.

Navigate to the created demo alert and note the following asset details:

- Computer Name
- File Name
- File Hash
- Source IP

Select the alert and launch the playbook **Investigate Malware Response (Splunk/QRadar/FortiEDR)** to perform following automated tasks:

- Find malicious indicators in the alert and scanning the endpoint
- Investigate endpoint manually, to detemine if this is malicious activity, if no malicious indicators found 
- Hunt the malicious indicators using Splunk, QRadar, and FortiEDR
- Block the malicious indicators
